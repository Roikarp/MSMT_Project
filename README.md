# MSMT_Project
Multi-Threaded computing has become an essential tool for researchers and developers to efficiently process vast amounts of data and improve system performance. The ability to exploit hardware in order to improve the overall system performance is expected to continue to grow as the scale and complexity of data continue to increase. In this article, we would like to analyze MSMT using a configurable objected-oriented software simulator
